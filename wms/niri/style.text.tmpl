    // When to center a column when changing focus, options are:
    // - "never", default behavior, focusing an off-screen column will keep at the left
    //   or right edge of the screen.
    // - "always", the focused column will always be centered.
    // - "on-overflow", focusing a column will center it if it doesn't fit
    //   together with the previously focused column.

        // For example, you can perfectly fit four windows sized "proportion 0.25" on an output.

    // By default focus ring and border are rendered as a solid background rectangle
    // behind windows. That is, they will show up through semitransparent windows.
    // This is because windows using client-side decorations can have an arbitrary shape.

    // If you don't like that, you should uncomment `prefer-no-csd` below.
    // Niri will draw focus ring and border *around* windows that agree to omit their

        // You can also use gradients. They take precedence over solid colors.
        // Gradients are rendered the same as CSS linear-gradient(angle, from, to).
        // The angle is the same as in linear-gradient, and is optional,
        // defaulting to 180 (top-to-bottom gradient).
        // You can use any CSS linear-gradient tool on the web to set these up.

        // However, instead you may want to set prefer-no-csd and/or
        // geometry-corner-radius. Then, niri will know the corner radius and
        // draw the shadow correctly, without having to draw it behind the
        // window. These will also remove client-side shadows if the window
        // draws any.
